# ChangeRequest

```js
import {ChangeRequest} from 'dataparcels';
import {ChangeRequest} from 'react-dataparcels';
```

```flow
new ChangeRequest({
   action: Action|Action[] = []
});
```

ChangeRequests are used by `dataparcels` to communicate changes back to the top level Parcel. Most of the time these operate invisibly.
