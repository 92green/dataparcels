Dataparcels is a bunch of stuff.

- If you just want a simple form, something like [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) will suit your needs.
- Build user interfaces backed by the shape of your data. As the shape of your data changes, the shape of your UI changes too.
- Undo and redo
- Buffering and debouncing
- No schemas or top-level object definitions, unless you want them
- Async fetching, submitting and validation
- Can coordinate prop changes blah blah
- Can rebase buffered changes onto new data
- Drag and drop arrays
- Can store metadata against parts of your data shape


"Forms" have too much baggage, too many opinions.
Solve the underlying problem.

## Installation

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` with React:

```bash
yarn add react-dataparcels # ...or npm install react-dataparcels --save
```

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` *without* React:


```bash
yarn add dataparcels # ...or npm install dataparcels --save
```

Beware that most of the examples on these docs assume that React is being used. If you'd like to use `dataparcels` core classes without React it's completely possible to do so; [drop us a line](https://www.github.com/92green/dataparcels/issues) if you do as we'd love to know about your use case.

All online library discussion happens over on [Github](https://github.com/92green/dataparcels).

I hope this library helps solve some front-end editor problems for you. ðŸŽ‰
