# Data synchronisation

Data synchronisation encompasses how dataparcels interacts with pieces of data stored externally.

**This part of the library is being developed and will be complete soon.**

## Saving data from a form

The simplest type of data synchronisation is a typical web form that can be submitted. Typical forms are often initially blank, or may occasionally preload some data from a server. Once the form is presented to the user it is the master of its own state. The data flow from this point on is unidirectional e.g. the form sends data to the server, and the server never pushes data back into the form.

<SubmitButtonOnChange />
<Code language="jsx">{SubmitButtonOnChangeSource}</Code>

## Changing or clearing form data after save

You can set the data in the form to something else after it's sent its data by setting `onChangeUseResult` to true. The form's current state will be replaced by whatever returned from `onChange`.

<SubmitButtonOnChangeClear />
<Code language="jsx">{SubmitButtonOnChangeClearSource}</Code>
