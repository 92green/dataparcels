## Development

Dataparcels is written and maintained by <a href="https://damienclarke.me/">Damien Clarke</a>, with feedback from <a href="https://github.com/allanhortle">Allan Hortle</a> and others at <a href="https://blueflag.com.au/about-us/">Blueflag</a>.
All online library discussion happens over on <a href="https://github.com/blueflag/dataparcels">Github</a>.

As this library matures I intend to make it easier for other to help out, such as guidelines for contributing, design rules and philosophies this library uses, developement setup, and details on dataparcels internal architecture.

I hope this library helps solve some front-end problems for you.
