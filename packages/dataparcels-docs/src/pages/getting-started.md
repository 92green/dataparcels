# Getting Started

## Installation

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` with React:

```bash
yarn add react-dataparcels # ...or npm install react-dataparcels --save
```

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` *without* React:


```bash
yarn add dataparcels # ...or npm install dataparcels --save
```

Beware that most of the examples on these docs assume that React is being used. If you'd like to use `dataparcels` without React it's completely possible to do so; [drop us a line](https://www.github.com/blueflag/dataparcels/issues) if you do as we'd love ot know about your use case.
