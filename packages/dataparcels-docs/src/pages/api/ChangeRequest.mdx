# ChangeRequest

When a change occurs, ChangeRequests are used by Parcels to describe what to change and how to change it. These ChangeRequests are propagated upward to the top level Parcel.

ChangeRequests contain an array of actions to perform.

ChangeRequests can most often be accessed in `handleChange` and `modifyUp` functions. Most of the time these operate invisibly, and it's rare that you'll create these yourself.

```js
import ChangeRequest from 'dataparcels/ChangeRequest';
import ChangeRequest from 'react-dataparcels/ChangeRequest';
```

```flow
new ChangeRequest({
   action: Action|Action[] = []
});
```

## <DocsSectionHeading>Properties</DocsSectionHeading>

### prevData

```flow
prevData: Object (ParcelData)
```

Returns the Parcels data before the change was applied.

### nextData

```flow
nextData: Object (ParcelData)
```

Returns the Parcels data after the change was applied.

### originId

```flow
originId: string
```

Returns the id of the Parcel that initiated the change request.

### originPath

```flow
originPath: Array<number|string>
```

Returns the path of the Parcel that initiated the change request.

### actions

```flow
actions: Array<Action>
```

Returns the array of actions that this ChangeRequest contains. These actions are reduced onto `prevData` to produce `nextData`.

## <DocsSectionHeading>Methods</DocsSectionHeading>

### hasValueChanged()

```flow
hasValueChanged(keyPath: Array<string|number>): boolean
```

Return a boolean indicating if the value at the given `keyPath` has changed any of its data as a result of this ChangeRequest.

### getDataIn()

```flow
getDataIn(keyPath: Array<string|number>): Object
```

A convenience method for returning the previous and next data for a Parcel at the given `keyPath`.

```js
let parcel = new Parcel({
    handleChange: (parcel, changeRequest) => {
        console.log(changeRequest.getDataIn(['abc', 'def']));
        // ^ the above logs out
        // {
        //     prev: {
        //         value: 123,
        //         meta: {},
        //         ...
        //     },
        //     next: {
        //         value: 456,
        //         meta: {},
        //         ...
        //     }
        // }
    }
    value: {
        abc: {
            def: 123
        }
    }
});

parcel
    .get('abc')
    .get('def')
    .set(456);

// ^ sets abc.def to 456
```

### merge()

```flow
merge(other: ChangeRequest): ChangeRequest
```

Merges the `other` ChangeRequest onto this ChangeRequest. Actions from `other` are appended to the current ChangeRequest. As a performance boost, if two subsequent `set` actions with the same `keyPath` are merged into each other, the first will be removed.
