# Getting Started

## Installation

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` with React:

```bash
yarn add react-dataparcels # ...or npm install react-dataparcels --save
```

If you'd like to use `dataparcels` *without* React:


```bash
yarn add dataparcels # ...or npm install dataparcels --save
```

Beware that most of the examples on these docs assume that React is being used. If you'd like to use `dataparcels` without React it's completely possible to do so; [drop us a line](https://www.github.com/blueflag/dataparcels/issues) if you do as we'd love to know about your use case.

## Hello World

This is a simple example that demonstrates some basic ideas about using dataparcels.

Say we want to allow the user to edit the fields in the following data structure:

```js
{
    firstname: "Robert",
    lastname: "Clamps",
    address: {
        postcode: "1234"
    }
}
```

We could do something like this.

<EditingObjects />

```js
import React from 'react';
import useParcelState from 'react-dataparcels/useParcelState';
import ParcelBoundary from 'react-dataparcels/ParcelBoundary';

export default function PersonEditor(props) {

    let [personParcel] = useParcelState({
        value: {
            firstname: "Robert",
            lastname: "Clamps",
            address: {
                postcode: "1234"
            }
        }
    });

    return <div>
        <label>firstname</label>
        <ParcelBoundary parcel={personParcel.get('firstname')}>
            {(firstname) => <input type="text" {...firstname.spreadInput()} />}
        </ParcelBoundary>

        <label>lastname</label>
        <ParcelBoundary parcel={personParcel.get('lastname')}>
            {(lastname) => <input type="text" {...lastname.spreadInput()} />}
        </ParcelBoundary>

        <label>postcode</label>
        <ParcelBoundary parcel={personParcel.getIn(['address', 'postcode'])}>
            {(postcode) => <input type="text" {...postcode.spreadInput()} />}
        </ParcelBoundary>
    </div>;
};


```

### What's going on?

* `react-dataparcels` is imported.
* It stores the data in state using the [useParcelState](/api/useParcelState) hook. The parcel contains the data.
* The `.get()` method is used to branch off and create smaller parcels containing just `firstname`, `lastname` and `postcode`.
* `.spreadInput()` is used to provide the `value` and `onChange` props to the `input` elements, controlling their values and handling their changes.
* It's using the [ParcelBoundary](/api/ParcelBoundary) React component to make sure that inputs are only re-rendered if their values have changed. This isn't *required*, but it is **very** recommended. Without this, all inputs will re-render any time any data changes.
Notice how changes to each of the fields are merged into the original data structure for you. Ths example works well, but there are a few improvements to be made.
