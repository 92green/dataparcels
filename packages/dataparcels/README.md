# ðŸ“¦ Dataparcels

A super declarative user input library that works really well with React.

*Almost done!*

### [See the very very unfinished docs](https://blueflag.github.io/dataparcels)

## Installation

If you're using React, run `yarn add react-dataparcels`.

If you aren't, run `yarn add dataparcels` (and then tell me about your use case!)
